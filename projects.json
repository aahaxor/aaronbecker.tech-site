At the time, I didn't have time to make a full video game with it, but several months later I decided to start. Making a game was an interesting exercise, since I had to figure out some new concepts, including making a lightweight audio engine, as well as optimization. Optimizing my code was especially difficult, since I had to think about the ways that I could make a process shorter, or subtract some superfluous code.",

I ended up making this small demo to demonstrate the rendering and collision possibilities. While I was working on this project, I learned a lot about several new programming techniques, including a render buffer, 2d collision, and a render loop.",

A friend and I worked together on completing this robot in time for the camp to end. During spring of the next year, I remade it with 3d printed parts and a multi-relay drive system, which allowed independent control of each wheel. I learned some important skills from this project, including using RF (Radio Frequency) antennas, and using relays to drive motors. These skills allowed me to make a robot that was both functional and useful.",

Made from a popsicle stick frame covered in black duct tape, using an Arduino Nano and a RF receiver, it took signals from two joysticks and sent it to the Arduin-O-Rover. While making this project, I learned more about how to use RF signals, how to read the signals from joysticks, and finally coding strategies such as a 'heartbeat' between the controller and car to see if they were still connected.",

While we were biking, however, we had no idea how far we were biking, or how fast, which made it difficult to calculate the most efficient route to school. I spent several weeks working on this project, starting with the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) inside. This was the first major project of mine that required its own circuit board, and I had to design one from scratch. I also had to work on the casing for the bike computer, and the casing for the screen as well, which had to be 3d modeled and then printed on a 3d printer. I also had to write the code that actually calculated how fast, in MPH, you were going from the interval per rotation of the wheel (calculated from a magnetic sensor on the wheel). I learned a lot of skills from this project, including 3d modeling skills that were required to build the case, and programming skills which I used to figure out how fast the wheel was going.",

Made during spring break of my 4th grade year, this project represents one of the first times that I ever soldered something together. Starting from a kit, I soldered all the pieces on. The skill of soldering, as has been mentioned, is one that I use a lot in most of my other projects and an essential skill to the home maker.",

            "description": "During the summer of 3rd grade, I went to a summer camp. Unlike most other summer camps, at this one, me (and a few friends) built wooden push go-karts! After a week spent building our go-karts, we took them home. When I got home, I pushed mine around a bit and realized something was missing: lights! I spent several weeks working on a basic system that took the voltage from a 9V battery/resistor and a switch on the 'dash', and wired it to simple LED lights, and it worked! My go-kart now had lights. I learned one important skill from this project, which was the basics of working with wood. I had to figure out how to drill holes in the car for the lights, as well as cutting the actual car out of a sheet of wood. The skill of working with wood is one that I use quite often on many other projects today, and one that I will use for future projects.",
